Summary of  my Approach for this Task:
**Objective**:
Create a functional To-Do List application that allows users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.
install:
1) npm create vite@latest
2)npm install axios




**Challenges Faced While Building the CRUD To-Do List Application
Setting Up the Development Environment
1) I have to make Ensure that all dependencies and tools (Node.js, npm, json-server) are correctly installed. and i solved  Follow detailed setup guides and use version managers like nvm for Node.js. Verify installations using node -v and npm -v.

2)Error Handling is the main problem and handling those is main task and providing feedback to the user. I have made try/catch blocks for async operations and display error messages in the UI.


3)Optimizing Performance : Ensuring the application performs well with a large number of to-do items.  I have used Reactâ€™s key attribute correctly for list items. Optimize re-renders by memoizing components when necessary.


4)Updating and Deleting Items:  Ensuring the UI updates correctly after an item is updated or deleted.
Ans: Use key properties effectively when rendering lists. Update the state immutably to trigger re-renders.
